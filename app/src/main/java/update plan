# PROJECT SUPERNOVA: Attendance App 2.0 Roadmap

## 1. Project Goal
Transform the current XML-based, monolithic attendance app into a modern, offline-first, secure Android application using Jetpack Compose, MVVM Architecture, and Advanced Hardware integrations.

## 2. Tech Stack Upgrade
- **UI:** XML Layouts -> Jetpack Compose (Declarative UI)
- **Architecture:** Monolithic Activity -> MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) with Hilt (Dependency Injection)
- **Database:** Firebase Firestore (Cloud) + Room (Local Cache for Offline Mode)
- **Async:** Callbacks -> Kotlin Coroutines & Flow
- **Charts:** MPAndroidChart -> Vico or YCharts (Compose native)
- **Security:** SharedPreferences -> EncryptedSharedPreferences & BiometricPrompt

## 3. Phase-by-Phase Execution Plan

### Phase 1: The Foundation (Architecture & Login)
- [ ] Setup Hilt for Dependency Injection.
- [ ] Create `AuthViewModel` to handle Login/Register logic.
- [ ] Migrate `RegisterActivity` and `LoginActivity` to Compose Screens.
- [ ] Implement Biometric Login (Fingerprint) in the Login Screen.

### Phase 2: The Student Dashboard (Replacing activity_student.xml)
- [ ] Create `StudentDashboardScreen.kt` in Compose.
- [ ] Re-implement the "Hello Student" header and Bell icon.
- [ ] Replace static banners with a clickable, auto-scrolling `HorizontalPager`.
- [ ] Replace MPAndroidChart with animated Compose Charts (Pie/Line).
- [ ] Add the "Missing" Features:
    - [ ] "Grades" Card (clickable).
    - [ ] "Time Table" Card (clickable).
    - [ ] "Assignments" Card.

### Phase 3: The "Next Level" Features (Hardware)
- [ ] **Geofencing:** Add logic to check GPS before marking attendance.
- [ ] **Dynamic QR:** Generate a QR code that rotates every 10 seconds (TOTP).
- [ ] **Notifications:** Local notifications for low attendance.

### Phase 4: Teacher/Admin Module
- [ ] Create a separate login type for Teachers.
- [ ] Build a QR Scanner screen (using CameraX) to scan student phones.
